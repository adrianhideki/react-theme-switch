# React Theme Switcher with Tailwind CSS

This repo has the purpose of testing dynamic theming with pre-defined properties. I created the [theme context](./src/context/ThemeContext.tsx) to switch between themes and dark or light mode. The possible properties for theme are available into [theme-props](./src/theme/types.ts).

## Running the project

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

Run the project:

```sh
npm run dev
```
